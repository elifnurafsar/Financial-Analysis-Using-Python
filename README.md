# Financial-Analysis-Using-Python
Financial calculations using genethic algorithms in python
In this homework, we were supposed to work with DOW30 indexe's adjusted close variables from 2010 to 2021 and code some necessary functions to create intended portfolios.
In some cases (portfolio 11 and 12) I worked with PyGAD library (https://pygad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to build genethic algorithms.
>Other libraries I used in this code are:
  1. yahoofinancials (https://pypi.org/project/yahoofinancials/ )
  2. yfinance (https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/ )
  3. NumPy (https://numpy.org/ )
  4. pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/ )
  5. seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/ )
>Modules that I use:
  1. random
  2. datetime
